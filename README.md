# CloudBuzz-Task
In this Task I created AWS Lambda function in Python that calculates the sum of 2 numbers.
I also created AWS SNS topic so the result will be sent to you via Email, I created API Gateway that integrates with the Lambda function so you could insert 2 numbers in JSON format using Postman website and recive the result to both the email and Postman panel.
